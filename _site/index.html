	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I've spent the last 15 years trying to make the world a better place, primarily by using technology to bring people together.</p> 

	<p>That's meant everything from helping to elect a President Obama to founding a venture-backed startup.</p>

	<p>Along the way, I've played a lot of roles: managing large teams, leading software development, heading up marketing, fundraising, creating analytics products and directing campaigns--to name a few.</p>

	<p>But, in the end, the thing I love the most is working with a group of talented people to build something that actually matters.</p>

	<p>A few of the highlights:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>At <a href="http://moveon.org">MoveOn</a>, I developed a new approach to building a national field network: peer-to-peer organizing, backed up by modern web tools. With a small team, we were able to build a huge, volunteer-driven organization that was capable of matching the rapid pace of online campaigns.</li>
	
	<li>I also helped to design and run MoveOn's 2006 and 2008 electoral campaigns. Through these campaigns, we played a huge role in taking back the House and the Senate, and electing President Obama.</li>

	<li>As the Founding Director at <a href="http://newmediaventures.org">New Media Ventures</a>, I launched the country's first network of progressive angel investors.</li> 

	<li>Most recently, I co-founded <a href="http://scootnetworks.com">Scoot Networks</a>, the world's first network of shared electric scooters (like CitiBike, but with electric vespas). I headed up marketing and operations, and grew the organization from the germ of an idea to a fully operational network. We've been luckly enough to be backed by some of the nation's leading angel and institutional investors. I'm incredibly proud of the work our team continues to do.</li>

	<li>I've also had the privilege  to serve as an early advisor to some amazing do-gooder startups like <a href="http://upworthy.com">Upworthy</a> and <a href="https://ethicalelectric.com/">Ethical Electric</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I live in San Francisco with the lovely Natalie Foster (<a href="http://twitter.com/nataliefoster">@nataliefoster</a>) and our baby boy.

<h1>Recent Projects</h1>

	<p>Here's a running a list of a few of the non-work projects I've put together over the last few years. All are still ongoing, unless there's a date listed.</p>

	<div class ="project">
	<h2>Ewing &amp; Ewing Toys</h2>
	<p>One of my favorite things about being a father is that it's inspired me to start making toys. My own father is signficantly handier than I am, so this has morphed into a project for 3 generations of Ewings. Here are a few of our recent creations.</p>

	<h2>FRED talks</h2>
	<p>FRED talks are short TED style talks by your friends (or your friends-friends). I've been putting them together in San Francisco for a little while now, along with my wife <a href="https://twitter.com/nataliefoster">Natalie</a>, and our friends <a href="https://twitter.com/brattray">Ben Rattray</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cbracy">Cathrine Bracy</a>. We try to organize them every two months, and group them around a single topic. Topics have ranged from the future of cities to love (a Valentine's Day special) to the meaning of money.</p>

	<h2>This Site</h2>
	<p>I designed and built this site from scratch as part of an effort to increase my basic frontend web skills. It's fully responsive and held together by hand-coded HTML and CSS, with a little bit of javascript and jQuery thrown in for good measure. It's hosted on GitHub, and remains a work in progress.</p> 

	<p>The blog is a Jekyl template that I borrowed almost entirely from Barry Clark's <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now"> Jekyll Now</a> project--which is a great resource if you're looking to put together a simple blog.</p>

	<p>Icon's are courtesy of <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a> by Dave Gandy--which is indeed awesome.</p>

	<h2>Inequality Hackathon (2011)</h2>
	<p>Back when Occupy was the big thing, I organized a quick hackathon in SF. We had 60+ people show up and some great projects came out of it. One of them, Occupy Design, ended up becoming an actual organization and did some great work. You can read the details (and enjoy a photo of me very much needing a haircut) here: <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/10/17/hackathon-occupy-wall-street/">Venture Beat: Hackers join worldwide protest.</a></p>
