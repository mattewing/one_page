<p>Silicon Valley’s top startup program, Y Combinator, graduated its first class of non-profit startups yesterday.</p>
<p>As the genre defining startup accelerator, this is a pretty big deal. YC is the same institution that brought us household names like Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit and many more.</p>
<p>Traditionally they’ve been very focused on finding the next billion dollar company—and they’ve been quite good at that. So, what will it look like when they start working with non-profits? Well, now we have a few answers.</p>
<h2 class="notes-source-hasnotes">First, let’s meet the class</h2>
<p><a href="http://caremessage.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>CareMessage</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Uses SMS and automated voice technology to help hospitals and other care providers increase their engagement with at-risk patients.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.immunityproject.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Immunity:</strong></a> Crowdfunding their new approach to developing an HIV vaccine—and, if successful, they’ll offer it for free.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1deg.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>OneDegree</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Basically, Yelp for social services. Aims to make it easier for individuals discover non-profit social services (like low cost dental, or job training).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zidisha.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Zidisha:</strong></a> Peer-to-peer micro-lending. Like Kiva, but with lower interest rates (achieved by keeping things p2p, instead of using local financial institutions).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.noorahealth.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>NooraHealth</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Trains families to care for loved ones after they leave the hospital.</p>
<p><a href="http://codenow.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>CodeNow:</strong></a>Teaches kids in low-income communities to code through a mix of online and inperson training.</p>
<h2>Some trends emerge</h2>
<h3><strong>Product focused.</strong></h3>
<p>5 of the 6 are creating (mostly software) products—and the one outlier is helping kids learn to create software products. This isn’t surprising. The product focus means these non-profits will be able to benefit from YC’s core expertise of helping young software companies grow quickly.</p>
<h3><strong>Inspiring—and non-controversial.</strong></h3>
<p class="notes-source-hasnotes">These organizations all share super inspiring missions. But, it’s also important to note how non-controversial they all are. Who could be against creating an HIV vaccine?</p>
<p>Closely related is that none of them have structural approaches towards making the world a better place (i.e. advocating for schools to start teaching software dev in the classroom). Instead, they all focus on providing services. In other words, the belief that non-profits should play an important role in challenging or changing existing institutions and laws doesn’t seem to fit into YC’s selection criteria.</p>
<h3><strong>Donation dependent (for now).</strong></h3>
<p>Interestingly, most of these startups seem to depend on donations for income. I haven’t seen any their business models, but tellingly 5 of the 6 had a large donate button on their homepage. I can easily imagine that most could (and perhaps are already planning to) transition to a revenue generating approach, but it doesn’t appear to be where they’re starting from.</p>
<p>This is noteworthy because a big trend in the broader non-profit tech community is focusing on product based revenue generation from the get-go—so you’re not as dependent on the whims of major donors or subject to the long timelines and reporting requirements of major foundations.</p>
<p class="notes-source-hasnotes">I suspect that as the YC mentors gain more experience in watching their startups go through the process of raising major donations, you’ll see more of these non-profits launching with baked in revenue generation models.</p>
<h2>What it means beyond YC</h2>
<p>Y Combinator casts a long shadow in the tech world. So, bringing non-profits into the mix has the potential to create some really interesting change outside of the program itself.</p>
<h3><strong>Training Silicon Valley heavyweights to become donors</strong></h3>
<p>Despite it’s massive accumulation of wealth, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/27/omakase-charity-tech-industry/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tech industry isn’t great at giving money away</a>. Part of this is because there is little cultural focus on the virtues of being a donor. If you belong to a church, you’re encouraged to make a donation every week. If you’re an middle-aged executive at a major corporation, you’re encouraged to join some community organization’s board or at least host a fundraiser. Most founders and VCs have none of these influences.</p>
<p>YC has a huge role in setting cultural norms in SV, and beyond. It’s been great to see YC founder Paul Graham talk up Watsi (the first YC backed non-profit, which he sits on the board of) and YC partner Paul Bucheit offer <a href="http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2014/03/help-me-distribute-100000-to-new.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a $10 donation for each person who mentioned Zidisha on Facebook/Twitter</a>. If this level of engagement continues, hopefully you’ll see more if seep throughout the eco-system as it becomes normalized.</p>
<p>This has the potential to not only unlock a lot more money for non-profits, but also to create some really valuable mentors and connectors.</p>
<h3><strong>You can change the world with non-profits too?!</strong></h3>
<p>Silicon Valley is filled with really well intention people who want to change the world and make it a better place. Unfortunately, two other trends often get in the way:</p>
<ol class="post-list"><li>A very generous interpretation of what changing the world means (i.e. “Our photo sharing app is going to change everything!”)</li>
<li>A conviction that venture backed for-profit startups are the only vehicles capable of such change.</li>
</ol><p>Simply by accepting ambitious, world changing, non-profits into it’s program, YC is showing us all what’s possible and helping to blow up both of these narrow minded trends.</p>
<p>So, here’s to hoping this is the beginning of a new wave of big-thinking, do-gooder, world-changing startups that are solely focused on impact, not tax status.</p>
