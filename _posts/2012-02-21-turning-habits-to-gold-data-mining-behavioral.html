<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html" target="_blank">This NYT story on the power of habits</a>, and how companies are using their massive data sets to &#8220;help&#8221; us form new habits is an awesome exploration of the power of big data.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s focused on the commercial side of this, but since habits are central to everything we do, there&#8217;s clearly a lot of potential to do good with big data too (aka <a href="http://opower.com/" target="_blank">opower</a>) </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a well written piece with some great stories, so if you haven&#8217;t yet,you should read the whole thing. But if you don&#8217;t, here are a few take-away quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>As the ability to analyze data has grown more and more fine-grained, the push to understand how daily habits influence our decisions has become one of the most exciting topics in clinical research, even though most of us are hardly aware those patterns exist. <strong>One study from Duke University estimated that habits, rather than conscious decision-making, shape 45 percent of the choices we make every day</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><strong><br/></strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any repeated behavior into a habit, because habits allow our minds to conserve effort. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The process within our brains that creates habits is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain ﬁgure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. </span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><span>According to another recent paper, if you want to start running in the morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always putting on your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (like a midday treat or even the sense of accomplishment that comes from ritually recording your miles in a log book). After a while, your brain will start anticipating that reward — craving the treat or the feeling of accomplishment — and there will be a measurable neurological impulse to lace up your jogging shoes each morning.</span></p>
