<p>No one beats Hollywood when it comes to buzz building. But, I&#8217;ve never actually explored the mechanics before.

<p>Here are a few pieces that stood out:</p>
<ul><li>The marketing budgets for movies are HUGE. Often over $100m for big movies. In other words, studios often spend almost as much talking about the movie as making it.<br/> </li>
<li>The amount of time and energy spent on cultivation is amazing. Someone&#8217;s entire job is to work with anyone who blogs about the movie. Based on that, they&#8217;re able to use a large network of blogs to basically assist in the marketing campaign by releasing special posters, etc.<br/> </li>
<li>They ran a really nice, and very deliberate, campaign arc, with partnerships and releases mapped out months in advance.</li>
