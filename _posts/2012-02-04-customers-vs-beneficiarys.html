<blockquote>
<p><span>WaterHealth is a social enterprise, which means that even though it works to provide access to clean water in rural India, it has to work day and night to “acquire” and “retain” “customers.” As a social enterprise, our survival depends on customer satisfaction. And therefore, we have to listen to the customers and improve the product to suit their needs. The way the company has evolved over a relatively short period of time proves that we listen. NGOs and other aid organizations also try to design interventions in a participatory way, but <strong>the conversation is different when the community is a “beneficiary” instead of a “customer.”</strong> Even if the feedback is clear, the sense of urgency to act on it is not the same.</span></p>
